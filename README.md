In this repository you can find a varied and usefull programming codes that I used for the subject.
These are some basic programming with python modules that might be helpfull as examples.

Resources:

https://www.w3schools.com/ - Helped a lot with Matplotlib and also with different python modules.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ - Website where I got the datasets for the tasks.

https://scikit-learn.org/ - Got same examples more challenged to create better codings and graphics.

https://pandas.pydata.org/ - User guide to learn how to use pandas and all the different topics can cover.

https://matplotlib.org/ - Official matplotlib website, where I found different plots and what code use to 

https://seaborn.pydata.org/# - Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.

https://www.askpython.com/ - Blog that helped out with some tasks.

https://numpy.org/ - Open-source Python library that helps with efficient numerical and scientific computing. It provides powerful data structures like multidimensional arrays and a wide range of mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra functions.

https://chatgpt.com/ - When I was stuck on something or I was getting some errors, I resorted to the help of Chat GPT. I have never used AI before until this course, and I found it amazing, because is not that corrects your code, it also explain it, what is more helpful to understand.
